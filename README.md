# Emotion-Recognition-using-Natural-Language-Processing-and-BERT
Emotion is one of the important aspects of our lives that influences day-to-day activities including social behavior, friendship, family, work, and many others. Being able to recognize emotions can help us in various domains such as psychology, human-computer interaction, e-learning, marketing and many more. We did a comparative study on different approaches i.e., Traditional Machine Learning approach, Neural Network approach and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to evaluate which approach gives us the maximum accuracy, which has been evaluated on a dataset that was combined from dailydialog, isear, and emotion-stimulus datasets to create a balanced dataset with five labels: joy, sad, anger, fear, and neutral. We have targeted implicit emotion recognition which is a challenging problem because emotion is hidden within the text and solution to it is identifying the context of the text. The output generated will be emotions identified from the text classifyed into five labels joy, sadness, fear, anger and neutral. The BERT based model achieved 91.72% accuracy which is significantly greater than traditional machine learning, neural network approaches.
